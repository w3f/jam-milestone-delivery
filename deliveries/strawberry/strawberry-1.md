## Additional Information

This milestone submission applies to graypaper v0.4.5 . Note that at the time of submission not all test vectors are published yet. We pass current test vectors but new ones might be added in the future. Graypaper is still changing and these changes might break *current* version. New sections might be added that don't exist right now. We are always updating and keeping up with the latest graypaper in the main branch but note that current submission is for the latest v0.4.5.

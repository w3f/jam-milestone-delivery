## Context

>Please present your rationale for the completion of this milestone by connecting the deliverables and describing their purpose.

I am working on TSJam for about a year now following the graypaper updates and making some [pull requests](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/issues?q=state%3Aclosed%20is%3Apr%20author%3Avekexasia) to it.

The [real repository](https://github.com/vekexasia/tsjam) will be released under the Apache Licence v2.0 and has been manually [timestamped on the polkadot blockchain using the remark extrinsic](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/155tk9HmeJGsNZtA5LFasSCGZCdpAb2P2Gs6ej9JeP38sAww).

I can grant repository view access to anyone in the *Polkadot Technical Fellowship* beforehead to verify timestamps and the legitimacy of my codebase.

The project was developed entirely by me Andrea Baccega and it was written in TypeScript which is a superset of JavaScript (set C). 

## Deliverables

>Please check the relevant box to indicate which milestone you are delivering.

- [x] 1. IMPORTER: State-transitioning conformance tests pass and can import blocks.
- [ ] 2. AUTHOR: Fully conformant and can produce blocks (including networking, off-chain).
- [ ] 3. HALF-SPEED: Conformance and Kusama-level performance (including PVM implementation).
- [ ] 4. FULL-SPEED: Conformance and Polkadot-level performance (including PVM implementation).
- [ ] 5. SECURE: Fully audited.


>Please provide a list of all deliverables for the milestone and include links to the actual deliverables.

>Ideally all links inside the table below should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.

>If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective Notes column.
